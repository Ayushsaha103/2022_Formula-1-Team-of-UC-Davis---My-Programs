### State_Of_Charge_Data_Simulation
Simulate the current passed to vehicle battery pack w/ respect to time,
as well as resulting net voltage sensor reading, and net current sensor reading

### Kalman Filter
Estimates vehicle battery system's SOC (state of charge) with respect to time,
based off sensor readings for battery pack net voltage and current
